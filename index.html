                  <p>Sara got involved in the tech world when she was 15 as a Quality Assurance Analyst. She spent 2 years in high school testing insurance rating software (yawn) before moving to San Francisco to major in Sociology at the University of San Francisco. After a few years dabbling in other industries, Sara realized that software development was her true calling. She prefers to work with the full stack, and is quickly falling in love with robust javascript apps built with backbone. Her next goal is to improve her skills in javascript test frameworks. Testing is key! When not writing apps, Sara enjoys cooking and tries to spend as much time sewing as she does ripping out stitches. She also has an unreasonable love for period British dramas and has seen every film incarnation of Sense and Sensibility. She lives in Concord (which is definitely in the Bay Area!) with her husband, Zeph, and their two fluffy cats, Azrael and Jake.</p>

Despite graduating with a Computer Engineering degree, he never worked professionally in the tech industry, but his experience in other fields made him realize how much he loved software.  After spending some time slowly trying to learn on his own, Santiago decided to join GA in San Francisco to kickstart his new career in web development.  He is a javascript lover, fluent in Spanish and English, and is ready to use his new full-stack development skills to create amazing apps for people around the world.</p>

                  <p>During my stint at WDI, I gravitated towards creating practical web apps.  For the individual class projects I designed and built tools both for specialized use of existing web resources (Walktopus Google-map-based walk preview app), and for novel applications (Stitcherdoodle crochet and knitting project management app).  Prior to WDI I worked as an environmental engineering consultant and manager specializing in air quality.  I was responsible for scoping problems and identifying key questions; developing plans to address these questions; overseeing junior associates to complete analyses; and evaluating results.  I want to use my web app design and project management skills to develop tools that address diverse challenges in various sectors.</p>

                  <p>Having a love for coding was never the problem, rather being around it was at first quite rare. That changed when I started GuitarDistrict.com where I quickly had to learn the many concepts of web design and development. This passion and intrigue led me to learn more on my own and to eventually enroll in General Assembly's WDI program. I look forward to the next challenge where my entrepreneurial background is merged with my love for coding.</p>

                  <p>I’m a developer with a passion for branding, design and usability. My interests lean towards the front end, because I love to make beautiful, useful things. Having said that, my current obsession is playing around with server-side JavaScript frameworks (namely Node.js and Meteor). Before WDI, I was a copywriter for a creative agency, working on campaigns for global consumer brands. I became a developer so I could build things people want.</p>
